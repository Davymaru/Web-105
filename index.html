   <h1>Master Of Puppets</h1>

   <p>Today I am reviewing my favorite album of all time,  <b>Metallica's third album Master of Puppets.</b>  This album means alot to me and I listen to it almost 24/7, that being said since im a bass player this album is what helped inspire me to keep going with the hobby I can play all these songs from memory now.</p>
   
   <h2>The songs and the Sound</h2>

   <p>For this album the sound from their prievous album <q>Ride the Lightning</q> was improved apon.  <em>EVERY</em> song on this album is a Master... piece! from the speed of Damage inc. to the beauty orion this album has it all.  The guitar riffs are super fast and not to mention the snarlly bass tone that goes with that.  My personal favorite song is Orion, Orion is an instrumental completley composed by one member of Metallica.  This man is my biggest insperation and one of my heros in life, His name is Cliff Burton.  Cliff Burton was one of the best metal bass players to ever walk on this earth.</p>

   <h2>Cliff Burton</h2>

   <p>Cliff Burton would shred on his bass guitar like it was a normal electric.  On this album you can hear some of his solos on the song Orion and also you can hear his bass playing in the begining of damage inc, his bass echos harmonising with himself for about a minute before the guitars come in.  Cliff Burton taught metallica how to write haronies and how to propperly write solos, unfortunatly he passed seven months after master of puppets came out in a tragic buss acident. <q>When a man dies he murders some part of the world</q>- Cliff Burton, 1986 </p>
